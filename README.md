## Homework Instructions

*   [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/hw/hw09)

## Running your code and tests

Note that the Codio menu now provides two modes of running your project:

*   First “Compile” to update the code generated by your program.

*   Then use the “Run Game” menu. This will start your application.

*   To view the running application, in the menu bar to the right of the previous
    item, select View Game. Assuming that a program is running, it will show the
    running application in a new window or tab.
        
*   If you make JUnit tests, you will have to edit the .codioJUnit file to
    include them.

## Zipping and Submitting

Once you are finished, use the “Zip” menu item to create a file called “submit-hw09(-time).zip” and upload it here:
